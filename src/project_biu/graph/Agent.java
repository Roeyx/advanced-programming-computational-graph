/*
 * Represents the essential behavior required for an agent in a publish-subscribe or event-based architecture.
 * Each agent should be able to handle incoming messages, manage its internal state, and identify itself.
 *
 * Contract:
 * - getName(): Returns the identifier assigned to this agent.
 * - reset(): Clears or reinitializes the agentâ€™s internal state.
 * - callback(String topic, Message msg): Handles a message associated with a specific topic.
 * - close(): Carries out any cleanup tasks before the agent is terminated.
